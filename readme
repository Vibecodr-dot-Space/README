# Vibecodr (vibecodr.space)

Vibecodr is a social platform for publishing and remixing playable web "vibes" - small, shareable web apps and interactive pieces that run in the browser.

Tagline: the social runtime for your code.

If you like building on the web, Vibecodr is a place to:

- share what you made
- see what other people made
- remix it into your own thing
- learn in public without turning everything into a product pitch

This README is the public-facing overview for vibecodr.space as it exists on **January 29, 2026**. It is intentionally honest: it explains what Vibecodr is, how to use it, the values I'm building around, and the practical constraints you should understand before you invest time here.

Factual claims in this document are based on what the codebase actually implements (including feature flags) - not on aspirational docs.

## If you only read one section

Vibecodr is for people who want the internet to feel more like:

- "try this thing I made"
- "here's the remix"
- "I learned something; you can too"

...and less like:

- "engagement farm"
- "fake launches"
- "scrolling past screenshots of code you'll never run"

You post playable work. Other people can run it instantly. The social layer is built around that reality.

## Why now?

The closure of Glitch left a hole in the ecosystem. For years, it was the place where you could just _build_—no DevOps, no deployment pipelines, no "production readiness." Just an idea, some code, and a URL.

Meanwhile, the barrier to creating code has never been lower. AI tools, better documentation, and abundant learning resources mean more people can write code than ever before. But the barrier to _deploying_ that code? That's gone up. Now you're expected to know Docker, cloud providers, SSL certificates, and CI/CD just to share a tiny experiment.

I think that's backwards.

The question shouldn't be "how hard is it to deploy?" It should be "what did you build?"

---

## Why me?

I'm Braden. I built Vibecodr because I'm exactly the person it's for.

I love to build. I love to create. I want to be in a community of people who build just to build—who get excited about a clever animation, a weird interaction, or a half-finished prototype. People who share their work not because it's a product pitch, but because sharing is part of the fun.

I want the power of full hosting (because sometimes you do need secrets, APIs, and server-side logic), but the focus is on people who just want to _vibe_. Ship something small. Share it. Move on to the next thing. No quarterly planning required.

---

## What I've been building lately

I use Vibecodr to scratch my own itches. Recent vibes:

- A flight simulator
- A vibe that fetches random images from a database of over 25,000 dogs :)
- A "Bad day button" that spits out confetti when you need some encouragement.


## One sentence

Vibecodr is the social runtime for your code: post something people can actually run, not just something they can scroll past.

---

## Who Vibecodr is for

If any of these sound like you, you'll probably fit here:

- You like making small web experiments, not just "apps".
- You learn by remixing and tweaking real examples.
- You want a place where shipping something tiny is celebrated.
- You care about creative tools, UI, interaction, and craft.
- You want a community that is social without being unsafe.

If you need a platform that guarantees uptime for your business, has enterprise compliance, or gives you a full server to run anything you want, Vibecodr is not trying to be that.

---

## What you can do on Vibecodr (today)

### Publish and play

- Create vibes with HTML/CSS/JS/TSX.
- Run them in an isolated player.
- Publish them as posts that other people can launch instantly.

The goal is not just "hosting". The goal is a format that encourages trying and responding:

- If it is interactive, people can feel it in seconds.
- If it is visual, people can see it move.
- If it is educational, people can remix it and learn by changing it.

### Remix culture

- Remix other people's vibes into your own variants.
- Use remixing as a legitimate workflow: "start from something real" is a feature, not a shortcut to shame.
- Expect social norms around credit and attribution.

### Social primitives

- Profiles and identity (a place where your work lives).
- Feed and discovery surfaces.
- Follows, likes, and threaded comments.
- Conversations (threaded discussions). Note: direct messages exist in the codebase but are **deprecated and disabled by default**.
- Shares and embeds (so vibes can travel).

Vibecodr is not only runnable code. Context matters. Posts can include explanation, intent, and narrative - the "why" behind the vibe - so other people can learn and respond.

### Optional automation and integration

- Attach a pulse when you need secrets or server-side automation.
- Use it for things like API calls that require credentials, inbound webhooks, or scheduled actions.

---

## The idea (in slightly more detail)

Most social platforms treat code as:

- screenshots
- snippets
- threads
- "link in bio"

Vibecodr treats code as something you can _run_.

That changes the culture:

- It makes feedback practical ("I tried it and it broke on mobile" is more useful than "cool").
- It makes learning faster (the best tutorial is a working artifact you can remix).
- It makes creativity visible (interaction design, performance, polish, weirdness).

Vibecodr is designed around that: playable posts first, everything else second.

---

## What you can use Vibecodr for (examples)

These are typical "vibes" that fit the platform well:

- A music visualizer that reacts to your microphone—my friend built one in 20 minutes during lunch. It's janky and beautiful.
- A tiny shader that looks like a lava lamp but for code.
- A UI component with that satisfying micro-interaction you keep replaying.
- A micro game that takes 30 seconds to play but you'll try five times.
- A data viz that finally makes one concept click for you.
- A landing page experiment that scrolls horizontally for no reason other than it feels cool.
- A "here's how I solved this" demo that saves the next person three hours of Googling.

You can also use Vibecodr as a portfolio that stays alive: not just images of your work, but the actual work running in the browser.

## Core principles (the "why")

### 1) Be Social

Vibecodr is built around the idea that creative work gets better when it is shared early and often.

That means:

- I optimize for sharing, discovery, remixing, and attribution.
- I want the default interaction to be "I tried it" instead of "This is PERFECT!".
- I treat creators as people, not content factories.

In practice, "Be Social" looks like:

- Posting runnable work, not just announcements.
- Remixing openly and giving credit by default, VC handles this for you through our family trees. 
- Leaving feedback that helps ("here is what I tried") instead of vague praise or dunking.
- Building a culture where people can be early, unfinished, and still respected.

### 2) Be Safe

"Safe" here means two things:

1. Safety for people: Vibecodr is not a free-for-all. Abuse, harassment, spam, scams, and targeted harm are not welcome. Reporting and moderation are part of the platform's job.
2. Safety for systems: runnable content can be dangerous if you do it wrong. Vibecodr is designed so that vibes run in a sandbox, without access to platform secrets, and with defensive boundaries around risky browser capabilities.

In practice, "Be Safe" looks like:

- Strong separation between the host site and the runnable vibe.
- Clear expectations: do not ship secrets in client code, do not publish malware/scams.
- Tools for reporting and enforcement when someone violates the social contract.

### 3) Be Permissive

I am pro-experimentation and pro-web.

That means:

- Use the web platform (HTML/CSS/JS) without needing permission.
- Bring frameworks and libraries when they make sense.
- Avoid unnecessary hoops - publish and iterate quickly.

Permissive does not mean careless. It means creative freedom within guardrails that protect users and the platform.

In practice, "Be Permissive" looks like:

- You can post tiny experiments without asking permission.
- You can be weird, playful, niche, or intensely technical.
- I default to enabling creativity, and I only add constraints when safety requires it.

## What is a "vibe"?

A vibe is a small, runnable web artifact:

- a micro app
- a visual experiment
- an interactive story
- a tiny game
- a data visualization
- a UI component demo
- a creative coding sketch

The important part is that it runs in the browser.

That also implies some constraints that are worth saying out loud:

- A vibe is not a server. There is no long-lived process you control.
- Anything you ship in client-side code is visible to users. That includes API keys (so do not put secrets there).
- If you need secret-bearing requests, scheduled jobs, or private integrations, that belongs in a pulse.

Vibes are meant to be:

- easy to try (no setup)
- easy to share (a link that just works)
- easy to remix (a starting point you can fork)

### What makes a great vibe

The best vibes usually have one or more of these qualities:

- Fast time-to-first-interaction: something happens quickly.
- Clear intent: the title/description match what it does.
- Respect for the user: no deceptive behavior, no surprise popups, no dark patterns.
- A "remixable core": a simple idea someone else can extend.

---

## What is a "pulse"?

Some projects need server-side behavior: secrets, webhooks, scheduled automation, API integrations, or non-public credentials.

On Vibecodr, that optional server-side piece is called a **pulse**.

High-level idea:

- Vibes run in the browser.
- Pulses run server-side (on Cloudflare Workers infrastructure).
- Pulses exist so you do not have to do the unsafe thing (put secrets into front-end code).

If you never need secrets or automation, you can live entirely in the "vibes only" world.

## How to use Vibecodr (user guide)

### 1) Explore

Start by browsing:

- the feed for what's new
- discovery surfaces for themes, tags, or categories
- profiles for creators whose work you like

Try vibes directly in the player. If the vibe is interactive, treat it like a tiny app: click, type, and explore.

Viewer safety tips:

- Treat a vibe like any webpage. Do not type secrets or personal data into random inputs.
- If a vibe requests permissions or does something surprising, close it and report if it seems malicious.
- Prefer remixing and inspecting to understand how something works, rather than trusting it blindly.

### 2) Create

Use the studio/editor to build a vibe.

Practical mindset:

- start small (a minimal demo is a vibe)
- make it runnable quickly
- iterate publicly

Good defaults when you're building for other people:

- Add a short description (what it is, what to click, what to expect).
- Make controls obvious (labels, hints, or an on-screen "how to use").
- Aim for accessibility where you can (keyboard, contrast, readable text).

### 3) Publish

When you publish, you are making a playable artifact others can run.

This implies responsibility:

- do not publish secrets in client-side code
- do not publish malicious or deceptive content
- assume anything public can be copied, embedded, and shared

If you're sharing something experimental, say so. "This is a WIP" is useful context, and Vibecodr is a good place for that.

### 4) Remix

Remix is a first-class pathway:

- remix to learn
- remix to collaborate
- remix to evolve an idea into a new direction

When you remix, be a good neighbor:

- keep attribution
- link back where appropriate
- call out major changes if you substantially altered behavior or intent

### 5) Share and embed

Share vibes where people already are: chats, social media, communities, docs.
Embeds exist so a vibe can show up outside Vibecodr without losing the ability to run.

If you embed your vibe elsewhere, remember: you are exporting an interactive artifact. Write a sentence next to it so the reader knows what they are about to run.

## Safety model (what to understand before you trust it)

Vibecodr is designed so that the platform can host runnable web content without turning every page load into a security incident.

Here is the high-level model:

### The goal of the safety model

The goal is not "nothing bad can ever happen". The goal is:

- reduce blast radius when something goes wrong
- make risky actions explicit and user-controlled
- keep platform secrets out of the runnable surface area
- give the community and moderators tools to respond

### Vibes run in a sandbox

Vibes execute client-side in a sandboxed iframe with strict CSP boundaries. The host page and the vibe communicate through a controlled messaging bridge.

### No platform secrets in the browser

The browser runtime does not get platform secrets. If you need a secret, the correct tool is a pulse (server-side), not obfuscation.

### Sensitive capabilities are explicit

Certain behaviors are inherently sensitive (clipboard, popups, downloads, etc.). Vibecodr treats capability access as something that should be visible and intentional - not silently granted by default. (You'll get a popup from the runtime asking for permission)

### Reporting and moderation exist

"Be Safe" includes social safety:

- reporting flows exist
- moderation tools exist
- audit trails exist for enforcement actions

I am not pretending this is a self-moderating utopia. Safety is a product feature.

### What you should still assume as a user

- You are running someone else's code in your browser. Do not grant trust by default.
- Vibecodr does not magically make untrusted code safe; it aims to contain it and catch it before it can do any hard during before bundling even occurs. 
- If you see suspicious behavior, report it. If you are unsure, close it.

---

## Social positions (what I stand for)

These are not slogans; they are design commitments.

### Positive-sum creator culture

- Remixing is celebrated.
- Attribution is expected.
- Learning in public is normalized.

### Anti-harassment and anti-abuse

I do not build a platform where creators have to trade safety for visibility.

### No secret shame

Many platforms implicitly reward "look what I built" narratives while punishing messy reality. Vibecodr is for process, experiments, half-finished drafts, and weird prototypes - not just polished launches.

### Practical optimism

I want the vibe of: "Try it, remix it, improve it, share back."

### What I am not trying to be

I am not trying to win by:

- maximizing outrage
- encouraging dogpiles
- optimizing for addictive scrolling
- forcing every creator into a growth funnel

If Vibecodr succeeds, it should feel like a workshop with a public door, not a casino with a timeline.

---

## What Vibecodr is not (boundaries)

- Not a general-purpose hosting platform for arbitrary servers.
- Not a place to run Node.js servers inside a vibe, that's what pulses are for. 
- Not a substitute for production ops, SLAs, or compliance programs, we're working on it, but for now it's just me building this and enterprise scares me <3
- Not open source by default (there is no license file; all rights reserved unless one is added) - this is not because I'm not a fan of OSS, on the contrary I have put so much thought into this, but, due to the nature of the platform, 
revealing all inner-working is itself a security risk, at some point I may or may not go fully open source, but I will opensource systems and pieces of the architecture that I believe are helpful, and show what's most important in vibecodr
over time. 

---

## The social contract (high-level rules)

This is the "toned down but real" version. If you use Vibecodr, you are agreeing to a basic set of norms:

- Do not publish malware, phishing, scams, or deceptive "download this" traps.
- Do not use the platform to harass, threaten, or target people.
- Do not dox people or publish private personal information.
- Do not impersonate people or organizations.
- If you remix, keep attribution and avoid misrepresenting the original creator's intent.
- If you publish something risky or experimental, say so.

If you see harmful content, use in-product reporting. Safety is a shared responsibility, and I take reports seriously.

---

## Privacy expectations (practical, not legal)

Vibecodr is a social platform. Treat public content as public:

- Public posts can be shared, embedded, copied, and indexed.
- Do not post secrets or personal data you would not want redistributed.
- When you run a vibe, you are running untrusted code in your browser. Do not type sensitive information into random inputs.

This section is not a legal policy; it is a reality check, for our official policies concerning privacy, you can find them at https://vibecodr.space/privacy and our terms and conditions at https://vibecodr.space/terms

## Status, limitations, and honesty about the roadmap

This is a passion project. Some weekends I ship three features. Some weeks I fix nothing but bugs that have been sitting in my backlog for months. The roadmap exists mostly in my head, in GitHub issues, and in the `#ideas` channel of my personal notes.

Vibecodr is actively evolving. Expect:

- features to change
- UI to iterate
- rules and guardrails to become more explicit over time
- me to break things and fix them at 2am

Paid tiers / billing:

- Paid plans exist, with limits enforced in code (storage, pulses, secrets, etc.).
- Billing and subscriptions are handled via Stripe (checkout + customer portal)
- I'm not trying to maximize revenue. I'm trying to keep the lights on while building something useful.

Self-hosting:

- The production architecture is Cloudflare-specific (Workers, D1, R2, KV, Queues, Analytics Engine).
- This repo is not presented or represented as a one-command self-hostable product.

---

## If you are publishing: a quick checklist

Before you post a vibe publicly:

- Remove any secrets (API keys, tokens, credentials).
- Assume your code will be viewed and copied.
- Assume your vibe will be embedded elsewhere.
- Make intent clear (title, description, what it does).
- If your vibe requests permissions or user input, explain why.

---

## Talk to me

This is a solo project (for now). If something's broken, if you have an idea, or if you just want to show me what you built:

- Open an issue on this repo
- Email: founder@vibecodr.space
- Or just publish something in vibecodr.space/conversations, seriously, that's the best way I check that page probably 6 times a day hoping to hear back from the early community. 

I read everything. I don't always respond immediately, but I do respond, and I do respond to any issues/bugs immediatly. 

---

## FAQ

### Can I use React? Vue? That new framework that came out yesterday?

Often, yes - Vibecodr is built to support common browser frameworks and libraries. If a dependency fails to load in the runtime, treat it as an environment constraint and adjust (or remix into a simpler approach), then submit a request for expansion and most likely I will get it done. 

### Where does my vibe run?

In the browser, in an isolated/sandboxed runtime. The point is that other people can run your vibe instantly without you running a server.

### Can my vibe keep secrets?

No. If it is in client-side code, it is not a secret. If you need credentials, use a server-side pulse and keep the client as a public artifact.

### Is Vibecodr open source?

Not by default. This repo does not include an open source license file, so you should assume "all rights reserved" unless that changes.

### Can I self-host Vibecodr?

The production system is Cloudflare-specific and this repo is not intended as a one-command self-host. If self-hosting matters to you, treat Vibecodr as an inspiration/reference, not a turnkey product.

### Is Vibecodr "done"?

No. Vibecodr is in active development. Expect iteration.
